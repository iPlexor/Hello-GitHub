 # Hello World

Technically its the default project template for a C# Console App, ostensibly a 1 line program thanks to Top Level Statements. 

**Starting Template & Finished App**

## Problem 1: Making it testable

So to make it testable, we add a test project.

1. Add an `XUnit` test project.
1. Add a reference the `HelloWorld` project.
1. Add this test:

```csharp
namespace HelloWorld.Tests;

public class HelloWorldTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void HelloWorld_Prints_HelloWorldEx()
    {
        // Arrange
        var location = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location;
        var baseDir = location.Remove(
        location.IndexOf(
            "\\HelloWorld.Tests\\bin\\Debug\\net8.0\\HelloWorld.Tests.dll", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase));
        var process = new Process
        {
            StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("dotnet", $"run --project {baseDir}\\HelloWorld\\HelloWorld.csproj")
            {
                RedirectStandardOutput = true,
                UseShellExecute = false,
                CreateNoWindow = true
            }
        };

        // Act
        process.Start();
        process.WaitForExit();

        var output = process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal("Hello, World!\r\n", output);
    }
}
```

`Pro Tip:` If you're doing TDD, remember to _pretend_ you wrote the failing tests _before_ you wrote the code to make them pass.

## Problem 2: Measuring Code Coverage

The easy, but very expensive way to do this is to buy a Visual Studio Enterprise license and switch Code Coverage on. If you prefer to save a few grand a year, you're not going to do that.

Instead, we'll use `Coverlet` to generate code coverage metrics when we run our tests and use `ReportGenerator` to show us the results.

1. Add the `Coverlet.MSBuild` NuGet package to the both projects.

   ```powershell
   dotnet add package coverlet.msbuild
   ```

1. Install the `ReportGenerator` tool:

   ```powershell
   dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
   ```

1. Run the tests and collect coverage using the dotnet test command with an absolute path.

   ```powershell
   dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover /p:CoverletOutput="$(pwd)/coverage/"
   ```

1. Run the `ReportGenerator` tool:

   ```powershell
   dotnet reportgenerator "-reports:HelloWorld.Tests/coverage.opencover.xml" "-targetdir:coveragereport" "-reporttypes:Html"
   ```

Amazing, ðŸ’¯% code coverage!

`Pro Tip:` If it doesn't generate `coverage.opencover.xml`, you've successfully reproduced my results. Somethings broken and needs fixing. Good luck!

Congratulations, you're a real Software Engineer now!

## Conclusion

Technically, `Main` is the entrypoint of `Program`, so testing it is technically an End-to-End test anyway! 

We might as well test the whole process, right?

Well, no. That's not how we do things. We test the smallest unit of code that we can, and we test it in isolation.

This is a silly example.
